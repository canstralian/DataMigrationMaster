# Dataset Migration Tool

_âœ¨ Migrate datasets to Hugging Face Hub in a few steps âœ¨_

While GitHub and Kaggle are great platforms, the Hugging Face Datasets Hub is a better place to host and share datasets.
Some of the benefits of hosting datasets on the Hugging Face Datasets Hub are:

- Hosting for large datasets
- An interactive preview of your dataset
- Access to the dataset via many tools and libraries including; datasets, pandas, polars, dask and DuckDB
- Seamless integration with machine learning workflows
- Version control and dataset versioning

This app will help you migrate datasets currently hosted on GitHub or Kaggle to the Hugging Face Datasets Hub.

Make sure you consider the license of the dataset when migrating it to the Hugging Face Datasets Hub ðŸ¤—.

_Note: the Kaggle implementation is experimental and may not work for all datasets. Feel free to open a PR to improve it!_

You should add a dataset card for your dataset to help people discover and understand your dataset. You can find instructions for creating a dataset card [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/dataset_card).
